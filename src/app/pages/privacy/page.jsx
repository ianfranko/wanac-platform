            <h2>7. When We Share Your Information</h2>
            <p>We may share your information in the limited circumstances described below:</p>

            <h3>7.1 Service Providers</h3>
            <p>We may share information with trusted third-party vendors and service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as website hosting, data storage, email delivery, payment processing, and analytics. These service providers are permitted to use your information only as necessary to provide services to WANAC and are expected to protect it appropriately.</p>

            <h3>7.2 Program Partners</h3>
            <p>In connection with specific programs, we may share relevant information with educational institutions, scholarship or fellowship providers, employers or recruiting partners, and veteran-serving organizations and nonprofits collaborating with WANAC. Such sharing occurs only where necessary to operate the program, fulfill your requests, or achieve the stated program purpose, and is subject to appropriate legal and contractual safeguards where required.</p>

            <h3>7.3 Legal, Safety, and Corporate Matters</h3>
            <p>We may disclose information if required to do so by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the rights, property, or safety of WANAC, our users, or others; to detect, prevent, or address fraud, security, or technical issues; or in connection with a reorganization or similar transaction involving WANAC, to the extent permitted by law.</p>

            <h3>7.4 Aggregated or De-Identified Information</h3>
            <p>We may use and share aggregated or de-identified information (which cannot reasonably be used to identify you) for research, reporting, and program evaluation purposes.</p>

            <h2>8. Donations and Financial Information</h2>
            <p>When you make a donation or payment to WANAC, your financial information is typically processed by a third-party payment processor or service provider. Depending on the method used, this may involve limited payment card details (usually tokenized and not stored by WANAC); transaction identifiers and donation amounts; and billing contact information. We use this information to process your transaction, issue receipts, maintain accurate donation records, comply with legal obligations, and communicate with you about your support, unless you ask us not to. WANAC endeavors to use payment processors that maintain appropriate security standards for handling financial information.</p>

            <h2>9. Email, SMS, and Other Communications</h2>
            <p>If you provide us with your email address, phone number, or other contact details, we may use them to send program-related communications (onboarding, scheduling, reminders, updates); share newsletters, impact reports, and opportunities to get involved; and invite you to provide feedback, participate in surveys, or attend events. You may opt out of receiving promotional or non-essential communications at any time by using the unsubscribe link in emails or by contacting us (see Section 18). Even if you opt out of promotional messages, we may still send you essential transactional or program-related communications. If WANAC offers mobile messaging programs (such as SMS alerts), those programs may be subject to additional terms and privacy notices, which will be presented at the time you enroll.</p>

            <h2>10. Cookies and Online Tracking</h2>
            <p>Our Sites may use "cookies" and similar technologies (such as pixels, tags, and local storage) to remember your preferences and settings; enhance your experience on the Sites; analyze usage and performance; and support certain features and functionality. You can typically configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Sites may not function properly if cookies are disabled. We may use third-party analytics providers (such as Google Analytics) that may collect information about your use of the Sites over time and across different websites. These third parties may set and access their own cookies, subject to their own privacy policies.</p>

            <h2>11. Data Security</h2>
            <p>WANAC uses reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect Personal Information against unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. These measures may include encryption in transit, access controls, and secure data storage practices. However, no method of data transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any credentials used to access WANAC services.</p>

            <h2>12. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary to deliver programs and services; maintain accurate records of participation and impact; comply with legal, accounting, and reporting obligations; resolve disputes and enforce our agreements; and support long-term outcomes and research, where permissible. Where possible, we may de-identify or aggregate information so that it no longer reasonably identifies you, and retain that information for longer periods for analytical and reporting purposes.</p>

            <h2>13. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
            <p>Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have certain rights regarding your Personal Information, which may include the right to request access, correction, or deletion of your Personal Information; object to or restrict certain processing activities; or withdraw consent where processing is based on your consent. To exercise these rights, please contact us using the information in Section 18. We may take steps to verify your identity before responding to your request. Where applicable, you may also have rights under specific state or national privacy laws. WANAC will seek to honor valid requests consistent with its legal obligations and mission.</p>

            <h2>14. Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our programs and Sites are primarily intended for adults and older youth engaged in transition, education, career, or related support. WANAC does not knowingly collect Personal Information online from children under the age of 16 without appropriate consent or authorization, as required by law. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from a child under 16 without appropriate consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete that information.</p>

            <h2>15. International Users</h2>
            <p>WANAC is based in the United States, and the information we collect is processed and stored primarily in the United States. If you access the Sites or provide information from outside the United States, you understand that your information may be transferred to, stored in, and processed in the United States or other jurisdictions that may have different data protection laws than your country of residence. Where required by law, we will take appropriate steps to ensure an adequate level of protection for cross-border data transfers.</p>

            <h2>16. External Links</h2>
            <p>The Sites may contain links to third-party websites, resources, or services that are not controlled by WANAC. These links are provided for convenience and informational purposes only. WANAC is not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices of such third parties, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to them. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites or services you visit.</p>

            <h2>17. How to Update or Correct Your Information</h2>
            <p>You may request that we update, correct, or modify certain Personal Information by contacting us using the information provided in Section 18. Where appropriate, you may also be able to update certain details directly through an online account or portal, if such functionality is provided.</p>
