## Test Your Setup

npm run dev

# 2. Navigate to a meeting page
# Example: http://localhost:3000/client/fireteam/experience/[id]

## What About the jitsi-meet Directory?

The `jitsi-meet/` folder you cloned is for **running your own server**. You don't need it right now.

**Recommended Action:**
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/wanac-platform
rm -rf jitsi-meet
```

You can always re-clone it later if you decide to self-host.

## Quick Commands

### Remove jitsi-meet folder (recommended):
```bash
rm -rf jitsi-meet
```

### Test your app:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### View documentation:
```bash
cat JITSI_SETUP_GUIDE.md
```
