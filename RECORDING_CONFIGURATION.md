# 🎥 Jitsi Recording Configuration

## ✅ Recording is Now Fully Enabled!

I've configured your Jitsi meeting platform with comprehensive recording capabilities.

---

## 🚀 What's Been Configured

### 1. **Jitsi Server-Side Recording**
Enabled in: `src/app/client/fireteam/experience/hooks/useJitsiMeeting.js`

```javascript
fileRecordingsEnabled: true,
fileRecordingsServiceEnabled: true,
fileRecordingsServiceSharingEnabled: true,
hiddenDomain: 'recorder.meet.jit.si',

recordingService: {
  enabled: true,
  sharingEnabled: true,
  hideStorageWarning: false,
},

localRecording: {
  enabled: true,
  format: 'flac',
},
```

### 2. **Enhanced Local Recording**
Upgraded in: `src/app/client/fireteam/experience/hooks/useRecording.js`

**Features:**
- ✅ **Screen capture with audio** (tries first)
- ✅ **Microphone-only fallback** (if screen denied)
- ✅ **High-quality video codec** (VP9 when supported)
- ✅ **Better error handling** with user-friendly messages
- ✅ **Chunked recording** (saves data every second)
- ✅ **File size reporting** in MB

---

## 🎯 How Recording Works Now

### **Dual Recording System:**

1. **Jitsi Server Recording** (Primary)
   - Records full meeting with all participants
   - Managed by Jitsi infrastructure
   - Only works for first person (moderator)

2. **Local Browser Recording** (Backup/Fallback)
   - Records screen + audio OR just microphone
   - Works for everyone
   - Saved locally in browser
   - Processed with AI for transcription/summaries

---

## 📝 Recording Options

When you click **Record**, the system will:

### **Option 1: Screen + Audio Capture** (Best Quality)
Browser will ask: "Share your screen"
- Select: **Entire Screen** or **Chrome Tab** with meeting
- Check: ✅ **Share audio** (important!)
- This captures **video + audio** from all participants

### **Option 2: Microphone Only** (Fallback)
If screen sharing is denied/unavailable:
- Only records **your microphone audio**
- Good for transcription and summaries
- Doesn't capture other participants

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Moderator Rights:**
- **First person** to join gets moderator rights
- Only moderators can use Jitsi server recording
- Everyone can use local recording

### **Browser Permissions:**
The system needs:
- 🎤 **Microphone access** (required)
- 🖥️ **Screen sharing** (optional, but recommended)
- Browser will prompt when you start recording

### **Free Jitsi Limitations:**
Using `meet.jit.si` (free tier):
- ✅ Local recording works perfectly
- ⚠️ Jitsi server recording may have limits
- 💡 For production: Consider paid Jitsi hosting or JaaS (Jitsi as a Service)

### **Recording Quality:**
- **Screen capture**: Full video/audio of entire meeting
- **Mic only**: Audio only from your microphone
- **File format**: WebM (widely supported)
- **Codec**: VP9 video (or fallback to default)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **"Recording not available" error:**
- Wait for Jitsi to fully load (green indicator)

### **"No recording to process":**
- Make sure you recorded something
- Speak/make noise during recording
- Check file size (should be > 0 bytes)

### **Poor audio quality:**
- Use screen capture mode (not just mic)
- Enable "Share audio" when selecting screen
- Check microphone settings in browser

### **Large file sizes:**
- Normal for video recordings
- Audio-only is much smaller
- Files are compressed as WebM
