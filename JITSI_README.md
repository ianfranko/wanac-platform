## 🎯 The Three Options

### 1. Public Server (FREE) - Current ✅
```
Cost: $0
Setup: Done
JWT: No
Best for: Development
```

### 2. JaaS (MANAGED) - Recommended for Production ⭐
```
Cost: ~$0.09/participant-minute
Setup: 1-2 hours
JWT: Yes
Best for: Production without server management
Sign up: https://jaas.8x8.vc/
```

### 3. Self-Hosted (CONTROL)
```
Cost: $20-100/month
Setup: 4-8 hours
JWT: Yes
Best for: High usage or full control needs
```

---

## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Now (Development) ✅ COMPLETE
```
Using: Public Server
Status: Working
Action: Keep building features
```

### Phase 2: Pre-Production (When Ready)
```
Using: JaaS (recommended)
Status: Code ready, needs signup
Action: Sign up at https://jaas.8x8.vc/
Time: 1-2 hours to implement
```

### Phase 3: Scale (If Needed)
```
Using: Self-hosted or JaaS
Status: Evaluate based on usage
Action: Review costs and decide
Time: Varies
```

## 📋 Quick Start Guides

### To Continue with Current Setup (Free):
```bash
# You're all set! Keep building.
npm run dev
```

### To Add JaaS (When Ready):
```bash
# 1. Sign up at https://jaas.8x8.vc/
# 2. Get credentials from dashboard
# 3. Install JWT library
npm install jsonwebtoken

# 4. Configure environment
cat >> .env << EOF
JITSI_AUTH_TYPE=jaas
JAAS_APP_ID=your-app-id
JAAS_PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"
JAAS_KID=your-kid
EOF

# 5. Uncomment code in:
# - src/app/api/jitsi/generate-token/route.js

# 6. Test
npm run dev
```

### To Self-Host (Advanced):
```bash
# See JITSI_SETUP_GUIDE.md for complete instructions
```

## 🔑 Environment Variables Reference

### For Public Server (Current)
```bash
# No environment variables needed
```

### For JaaS
```bash
JITSI_AUTH_TYPE=jaas
JAAS_APP_ID=vpaas-magic-cookie-1fc542a3e4414a44b2611668195e2bfe
JAAS_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
...your key...
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
JAAS_KID=vpaas-magic-cookie-1fc542a3e4414a44b2611668195e2bfe/4f4910
JITSI_DOMAIN=8x8.vc
```

### For Self-Hosted

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to do anything right now?
**A:** No! Your current setup is perfect for development. Keep building.

### Q: When should I add JWT authentication?
**A:** When moving to production and need secure, authenticated access.

### Q: Which JWT option should I choose?
**A:** JaaS for most cases (managed, easier). Self-hosted only if you need full control or have very high usage.

### Q: Can I delete the jitsi-meet folder?
**A:** Yes! You don't need it unless you want to self-host.
```bash
rm -rf jitsi-meet
```

### Q: How much will JaaS cost?
**A:** ~$0.09 per participant-minute. Example: 10 people for 1 hour = ~$54.

### Q: Is the JWT code ready?
**A:** Yes! Just need to:
1. Sign up for JaaS (or set up self-hosted)
2. Install jsonwebtoken
3. Add environment variables
4. Uncomment code

### Q: What's the easiest production option?
**A:** JaaS - no server management, secure, scales automatically.
